Multithreading:
 - Allows simultainious execution of two or more parts of a program
 - Each part of the program is a thread

Thread:
 - We can add more threads by extending the thread class but we can't extend any more classes because java doesn't accept multiple inheritences
 - Provides inbuilt methods such as yield(), interrupt() and etc
 
Running:
 - Can extend to other base classes
 - Achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class
 - Gives us an object that will give us an object that can be shared among multiple threads
