1. REPLACE SQUARE WITH CHARACTER
2. REPLACE BLACK SCREEN WITH BACKGROUND
3. DECIDE ON WHETHER TO USE THE SLEEP METHOD OR DELTA/ACCUMULATOR METHOD
(Don't know how to do DELTA/ACCUMULATOR method) but sleep method is what I did
However some say that the sleep method is in accurate so you can switch to Delta
and get rid of it (delete everything in the try and catch methods)

4. Explain what I did to the character shit cuz like I am so confused on what I wrote and I NEED an explanation
